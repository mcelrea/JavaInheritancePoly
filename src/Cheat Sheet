Inheritance
----------------------
  * super-class, parent class
  * sub-class, child class
  * The sub-class MUST call the super-class constructor FIRST
        * sub-classes inherit everything BUT the constructor
  * OVERIDDEN METHOD: a method that a sub-class redefines (or re-writes, changes)
  * OVERLOADED METHOD: a method with the same name as another method, but
                       a different method signature (parameters)
  * Calling super class methods:
        * a subclass can call super class method using super.methodName()
            * there is NO way to do super.super.methodName()
  * PRIVATE -> Blocks access for everyone (even sub-classes/children)
  * PUBLIC -> Party time....everyone has access!!!!
  * PROTECTED -> Children/sub-classes have access....everyone else is blocked
  * An object (variable) can only call methods that exist in the class it is
    DECLARED as.
        * After this is satisified....Polymorphism (echo, echo, echo) may take place!
  * Interfaces
        * CANNOT have variables except static and final
            * Example: static final double PI = 3.1415
        * interfaces are IMPLEMENTED
            * all methods need to be completed when implementing an interface
        * NO CODE ALLOWED
        * Purpose: to help organize code and program in teams.
  * Abstract classes
        * somewhere between concrete classes and interfaces
            * You write some code, but not all code
        * Must have at least on abstract method
            * a method that is not completed (no code)

Polymorphism
-----------------------
  * The ability for Java to call the correct version of a method when a object is
    stored in a superclass variable.
  * An object (variable) can only call methods that exist in the class it is.
        * After this is satisfied.....the correct version of the method will be called
            * What type of object is actually stored
                * for example:
                    * Enemy e = new Zombie();
                      e.attack() will call ZOMBIE's attack
