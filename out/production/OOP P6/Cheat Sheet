Inheritance
----------------------
  * super-class, parent class
  * sub-class, child class
  * The sub-class MUST call the super-class constructor FIRST
        * sub-classes inherit everything BUT the constructor
  * OVERIDDEN METHOD: a method that a sub-class redefines (or re-writes, changes)
  * OVERLOADED METHOD: a method with the same name as another method, but
                       a different method signature (parameters)
  * Calling super class methods:
  * PRIVATE -> Blocks access for everyone (even sub-classes/children)
  * PUBLIC -> Party time....everyone has access!!!!
  * PROTECTED -> Children/sub-classes have access....everyone else is blocked
  * An object (variable) can only call methods that exist in the class it is
    DECLARED as.
        * After this is satisified....Polymorphism (echo, echo, echo) may take place!


Polymorphism
-----------------------
  * The ability for Java to call the correct version of a method when a object is
    stored in a superclass variable.
  * An object (variable) can only call methods that exist in the class it is.
        * After this is satisfied.....the correct version of the method will be called
            * What type of object is actually stored
                * for example:
                    * Enemy e = new Zombie();
                      e.attack() will call ZOMBIE's attack
