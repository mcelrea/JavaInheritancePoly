Inheritance
----------------------
  * super-class, parent class
  * sub-class, child class
  * The sub-class MUST call the super-class constructor FIRST
  * OVERIDDEN METHOD: a method that a sub-class redefines (or re-writes, changes)
  * PRIVATE -> Blocks access for everyone (even sub-classes/children)
  * PUBLIC -> Party time....everyone has access!!!!
  * PROTECTED -> Children/sub-classes have access....everyone else is blocked
  * An object (variable) can only call methods that exist in the class it is
    DECLARED as.
        * After this is satisified....Polymorphism (echo, echo, echo) may take place!
